# Time-Series-Forecasting
Exploring-Time Series Data by emploring time series techniques like LINEAR TREND MODEL, LINEAR SEASONALITY MODEL, LINEAR TREND &amp; SEASONALITY MODEL, and SIMPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING MODEL. The time series data is coming from records of Australian red wine sales data between 1980 and 1994. In this exploration, we use the last 2 years of data as the validation dataset (hold-out sample). We will run the different forecasting models stated above and compare their model performance.
